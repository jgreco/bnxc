README for bnxc
===============

  bnxc functions as a fully capable XMMS2
  (http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/wiki/Main_Page) client with an Ncurses
  interface.  It includes scripts that generate a database file
  (conforming to the format defined in the assignment) from a directory
  defined in the enviromental variable $COLLECTION.  Usage is detailed
  later in this file.

  It requires that ncurses development and xmms2 development packages
  be present.

  For information on building see BUILD


bnxc usage.
===========

  (for general XMMS2 usage see the next section)

  "the collection" is a directory containing directories for each artist.
  each artist directory should contain directories for each album, which will
  contain the music files (ogg, flac, mp3) for that album.

  The names for each directory and media file will be used to organize the
  collection, NOT media file meta-data.


  Before the every run the ENV variable COLLECTION should be set to the *full*
  path of the music collection you want bnxc to use.

  Before the first run the script 'update-collection.sh' should be run.  This
  will generate the database file that bnxc will use.

  Once started, bnxc will present the user with a list of artists in the
  collection.  The user may select an artist using either the arrow keys, or
  j and k (vi keys).  At this point the user may chose to do one of the
  following:

	a - add all the tracks for that artist to the current playlist
	A - clear the current playlist and add all the tracks for that artist
	l or enter - display the albums for that artist
	q - quit bnxc

  If the user presses l or enter then a list of albums will be presented that
  operates in a similar manner:

	a - add all the tracks for that album to the current playlist
	A - clear the current playlist and all all the tracks for that album
	l or enter - diplay the tracks for that album
	q or h - go back to the artists menu

  If the user presses l or enter then a list of tracks will be presented that
  operates in a similar manner:

	a, enter, or l - add that track to the current playlist
	A - clear the current playlist and add that track
	q or h - go back to the albums menu



XMMS2 usage.
============

  XMMS2 is a client-server model mediaplayer for Unix-like operating systems.

  The xmms2 server is responsible for actually playing media and can be
  controlled by numerous other programs called xmms2 clients (bnxc is one of
  these).


  Once installed, the server may be started by issuing the command 'xmms2d'.
  After the server is running, any client may be started.

  Any number of clients may be used at any time and the server does not halt
  playback when a client is disconnected.  This allows the user to do things
  like use the standard xmms2 cli client to list the current playlist
  ('xmms list') while also using the full version of bnxc to add songs to it.
  (bnxc currently lacks some features like viewing the current playlist, the
  author suggests running the command `watch xmms2 view` in a seperate xterm).
