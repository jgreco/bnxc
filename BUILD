bnxc is an ncurses interface for browsing media and functions as an XMMS2
client.  The script 'update-collection.sh' (and it's helper script
create-db.pl) are included to automatically create a database
file from your filesystem.  (explained further in README)
To build this version you must uncomment the two preprocessor
defines in config.h and have ncurses and xmmsc development packages
installed on your computer.
